**#Voting Web**
This is an online voting system where I used HTML for structure, CSS for styling and Javascript for interactivity.
It allows the voter to sign up or login, vote for their preferred candidate and provide a description of the candidates.

**FEATURES**
Authentication page for user authentication
Voting page to vote by checking their preferred candidate
Aspirants page to check details about the aspirant
About page that describes the initiative carring out the election
